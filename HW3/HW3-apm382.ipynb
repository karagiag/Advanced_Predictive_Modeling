There should be a _fit_ function that takes parameters X, y, learning rate, and number of iterations, and a _predict_ function that takes an X value (optionally, an array of values). Use your new gradient descent regression to predict the data given in 'samples.csv', for 10 epochs, using learning rates: [.0001, .001, .01] .
